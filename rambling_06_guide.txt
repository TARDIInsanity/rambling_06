# How to use the <rambling_06> interpreter:
#   install some compatible python version. 3.8 thru 3.10 are compatible.
#   ensure importlib is installed (test by typing 'import importlib' in the console)
#   save, for user reference, the text file "rambling_06_help.py"
#       seriously, it's just one huge python comment.
#       well, it has some code, but that code is a comment to myself.
#   save "rambling_06_pyc_importless.py" to some FILEPATH
#   open up a python console in a compatible version.
#   paste::
import importlib.util as util
spec = util.spec_from_file_location("rambling_06_pyc_importless", FILEPATH)
rambling = util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(rambling)
del spec
# "rambling" now refers to the module.
# rambling.main() is the main loop
